<h2>This Is My First Article</h2>
<p class="side">B drive through the town of Bassa is a visual definition of social and class inequality, Bassa is a coastal town which has the dirt poor and the stinking rich.
 The Nigerians live like immigrants in their own home and the expatriates live like Kings, it was the case in every free African country from Ghana to Ivory Coast, 
 the colonial masters left but never left.
 </p>
 <p>Bassa, once an important place in the Dahomey Empire was now filled with locals who couldn’t rub two shillings together;
 fishing a main business of the Bassa people was now regulated and controlled by the big fishing companies owned by the expatriates and a select few Nigerians at the top.
 Nigeria has had its independence for 6 years but nothing has changed, the colonial masters have been replaced by expatriates and rich royal families that have connections;
 the saddest thing is that I’m a direct product of a broken system, a system designed to exploit the masses, a system Karl Marx will vehemently oppose, “unchecked capitalism”.
 </p>
<p> I often ask myself do I feel remorse from making the lower echelons suffer so that my family prospers. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don’t and sometimes I try not to think 
about it too much.
